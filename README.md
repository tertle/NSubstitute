# com.bovinelabs.analyzers

A package to easily add Roslyn Analyzers to Unity projects.

### Install
Add the package to your manifest.json file located under the Packages folder. 

```
  "dependencies": {
    "com.bovinelabs.analyzers": "https://github.com/tertle/com.bovinelabs.analyzers.git",
```

Alternatively download into the Packages/com.bovinelabs.analyzers folder. Please note importing to a directory outside of the Packages folder is not supported.

### Using
A simple UI interface is available at Windows/BovineLabs/Analyzers. This allows you change the target directory for the analyzers.

An option to import StyleCop (with a few custom rules for Unity) is available for use or as a test. If working, you should see your analyzers in your project references, under for example, References/Analyzers/StyleCop.Analyzers

### Requirements
* Unity 2018.3.0f2 onwards.
* Visual Studios (Rider support will come at some point)
* Scripting Runtime Verison .NET 4.x Equivalent 

Unfortunately as far as I can tell, other code editors such as Visual Studio Code do not support Roslyn Analyzers at this point. If I am mistaken please point me in the right direction and I'll see if there is anyway to support it.

Note, adding the package should not cause any issues to other team members who do use an unsupported IDE.
